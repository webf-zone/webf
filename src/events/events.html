        <h2>Year 2014</h2>
        <p>
            Year 2014 was the year of inception (Not the 2010 Nolan's Inception flick) for <span class="text-webf">&lt;web/F&gt;</span>.
            Only event we conducted in 2014 was <strong>Front-end architecture.</strong>
            We were trying to figure out bits and pieces of developer conference management.
            Right from arranging water to selection of venue, everything was new.
            We noted every possible feedback from our attendees and then laid track for the future of <span class="text-webf">&lt;web/F&gt;</span>.
            It only makes sense that we dedicate an entire blog post for this.
            Below is the link to 2014's <strong>Front-end architecture</strong> event.
