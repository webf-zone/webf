        <h2>Front-end architecture <small>July 9th, 2014</small></h2>

        <p>
            This very first event was conducted on 9th July 2014 at MCCIA, ICC Towers, Pune.
            It was not a full day event. We started at 9:00 AM and then finished by 1:00 PM.
            During these four hours we talked about:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>User experience, usability</li>
            <li>User interface and Javascript</li>
            <li>Front-end architecture</li>
            <li>CSS3 and new JavaScript</li>
            <li>MVC, MVVM and MV*</li>
            <li>Build process and its components</li>
            <li>Test driven development</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We also had guest talk by folks at Omni-bridge and CarIQ.
            Amit and Pritam (Omni-bridge) talked about <span class="text-bold">UI process workflow.</span>
            The last, not really front-end topic but but very much related <span class="text-bold">Product design</span> was covered by Sagar and Deepak (CarIQ).
            They really set the entire classroom on roller coaster ride that we will probably not forget.
